Version 2 of my old website

This one had a sonic theme, with a layout similar to the one of the old Sonic Adventure 1 website (http://www.sonic-adventure.com/)

I used the code of my profile on a pet website as a base for this, the person who made it had the thread hosting it deleted, so if the person ever comes across this, shoot me a message on my socials and I'll credit you. Link to the original (deleted) thread: https://pokefarm.com/forum/post/4549633
